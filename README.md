### Description
---
For this assignment, I followed the instructions and began with an html skeleton of the page (Screenshot 1). I then began to flesh out the font and other features. I moved into flexboxes and after a bit of work, found flexboxes to be fairly intuitive. I found difficulty mainly with the dynamic parts of the flexboxes, like adjusting to screen width, and centering, but after a bit of tweaking, I got the page to look fairly pretty both in mobile and desktop (Screenshots 2-5).
